# Mitigate Networking CVE

This repo is to show how to write a Playbook to mitigate [CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)s for networking devices.  This is used as a demonstration only and should be modified to run in your particular environment.  For demonstration purposes are trying to write for [CVE-2018-0171](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2) for IOS and IOS-XE which we treat as one networking platform from an Ansible perspective.
